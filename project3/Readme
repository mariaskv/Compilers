Compilers - Fall 2021-2022

Project 3:

Compilation:
make compile : Compiles all the files of the project

Execution: java Main <filename>

    Creates a file with name: filename.ll
    Executes as: clang filename.ll a.out
                ./a.out

About the Code:

This Project was about implementing a compiler for MiniJava to LLVM code.

For this reason we implemented a third visitor with name: Visitor3 which crosses the file and turns the java code into llvm code. It uses the SymbolTable created from the first Visitor.
